### Config for this Maxima process

# As a sanity check, this must match the name of the containing folder, but not the full path.
# Typically this is the name of the version number of the current STACK, e.g. 20160922001
name = ${VER}

# Whether processes of this type should be automatically made available when
# the server starts.
auto.start = true

### Maxima related commands and parameters

# Working directory for the process
working.directory = /tmp

# Command-line to launch the optimised Maxima process.
# This information is given at the end of the STACK healthcheck script.  It will need to be updated
# to reflect the move of the optimised image to /var/lib/maxima/%%VERSION%%/
# This will depend on your maxima (and lisp) setup.  E.g.
# /usr/lib/clisp-2.49/base/lisp.run -q -M /var/lib/maxima/%%VERSION%%/maxima_opt_auto.mem
# Do not include the "timeout" command.  The servlet deals with timeouts itself.
command.line = ${MAXIMAPOOL}/${VER}/maxima-optimised
#command.line = /usr/bin/maxima

# Input the load command after this, if defined.
process.started = Maxima restarted
#process.started = maxima.sourceforge.net

# A file to load to maxima using load(""); set to false or empty if not needed
extra.file = ${MAXIMAPOOL}/${VER}/maximalocal.mac

# The process has loaded when this appears.
process.ready = "${MAXIMAPOOL}/${VER}/maximalocal.mac"


# Environment variables may be set like this, in most cases you should not need to set them:
# env.LANG = C
# env.TERM = xterm

### File handling related parameters
# these make the difference between shared filesystem installations and truly
# separate servers

# Do we handle files?
file.handling = true

# The command template to pass the current working and output directories to the process, use placeholders to mark the paths, depending on your system we may escape \-chars in the path.
# Usable placeholders:
#  %WORK-DIR% the directory that won't be transferred to the client side
#  %WORK-DIR-NE% use this if you do not want \-chars escaped
#  %OUTPUT-DIR% the directory that will be transferred to the client side
#  %OUTPUT-DIR-NE% use this if you do not want \-chars escaped
path.command = maxima_tempdir: "%WORK-DIR%/"$ IMAGE_DIR: "%OUTPUT-DIR%/"$ URL_BASE: "%PLOT-URL-BASE%"$


### Maximum lifetimes.

# This is the time that a process is allowed to take when starting up (ms).
startup.timeout = 10000

# This is the time added to the lifetime of a process when it is taken to use
# so that it wont be killed while in use (ms).
execution.timeout = 30000

# This is the lifetime given to a process (ms).
maximum.lifetime = 600000


### Estimates used to start the pool size planning.

# Estimated time to start a process of this type (ms).
startup.time.estimate = 2000

# Estimated demand for these processes (number per second).
demand.estimate = 0.1
